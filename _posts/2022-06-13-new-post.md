# WT 8 Amp key

My first key! Well, I had to start somewhere. I had limited knowledge about morse keys, and didn't
want to blow the budget on a first unknown key, so was looking for something nice, well made (not
junk), but at a reasonable (that is, cheap!) price.

I ended up with a WT 8 AMP as my first purchase.

## The key

The WT 8 AMP is fairly ubiquitous. There are many of them, and many styles of them. A good reference
is the summary from the [Morsum Magnificat](http://www.n7cfo.com/tgph/Dwnlds/mm/mm.htm) magazine. In
particulary, the [WT 8 Amp reprints PDF](http://www.n7cfo.com/tgph/Dwnlds/mm/MMs/WT8A.pdf) has 57
pages of probably everything you could ever want to know about the WT 8 AMP key family.

The WT 8 AMP was a mainstay key was a mainstay of WWII. Literally millions were manufactured.

My specific key is a No.2 MKII ZA 2869 LMK. Looking at the Morsum reference above, it is likely the
key was manufactured between 1940 and 1942.

## How did it come

I purchased my key off ebay in November 2020. I paid the princely sum of Â£14, delivered. The key was
mounted on a base (see later), was a touch grubby, had one corner of the base broken, but generally
was in useable shape:

It was a bit stiff - the spring return was slow, like it was gummed up. A look at the pivot pin
showed it had some mild corrosion around the ends.

The base is interesting, in that it is a morse key base, but not for a WT 8 AMP. After some mild
cleaning and staring, I worked out it is a base for a
[Signalling Equipment Ltd. No. 2.N.P key](https://www.morsekey.net/signalling-equipment-telegraph-key.html).

Oh, and one corner of the bakerlite base of the key has fractured off. Not the end of the world. In
some ways that is a win for me, as slight damage that does not affect performance can mean I get a key
cheap. I'm really not looking for a pristine key, as long as it is fully functional.

## Cleaning up

First things first then - this key needs a clean. If nothing else we need to check out that corroded
pivot pin. Let's get it apart.

Taking this WT8 apart is not too hard. Pretty much undo the screw that is retaining the pivot pin,
and push the pin out. Here you can then see the state of the key. It's not terrible, but there is an
accumulation of crud around the pivots, and the pin itself could do with a clean.

The pivot pin was a bit stiff to remove - I seem to remember I took off some of the corrosion on the
very ends of the pin before pushing it through the pivot blocks and armature - no point forcing rust
through those holes if you don't need to.

Mostly I cleaned this with some mild soap and an old toothbrush. If I remeber rightly, I then used
something like a [garryflex](https://www.axminstertools.com/garryflex-abrasive-cleaning-block-ax20009)
block to clean up the pivot pin, and some mild metal polish to clean up the metal parts.

Now, what to do about that broken corner on the base. I resorted to my goto 'gap filler', epoxy putty.
I used some [milliput](https://www.milliput.com/) 'standard', as that is what I had to hand. I have
since purchased a multi-pack of various colours of milliput, so would have used the black milliput if
I had had it to hand.

Mix, apply, and once cured carefully file and sand it to shape.

Putting it back together is as easy as getting it apart. The pivot pin now slid into the pivot holes
much easier than it came out, and didn't have too much play.

Here is the cleaned up key, mounted on a new oak base. The screws I used are just a fraction larger
than I'd like, and sit slightly proud, but they are what I had to hand. I had to be careful with that
repaired corner, and in fact there is a slight crack opening up caused by the screwhead, but it is
still functional.

## How does it operate?

Well, this being my first key, I didn't really have a lot to compare it against. Since acquiring more
keys though, my first impressions have been borne out - this key is quite 'clacky' - that is, loud,
and has quite a hard stop. That's not really to my liking. I can live with the noise if I have to,
but the hard stop doesn't feel nice to me. I gather as one gains experience then you might be able
to transmit faster with a 'hard' key, but I'm just staring out, and want to try out some other
keys to see if all keys feel like this or not...

Still, I'd say the key is not looking too bad for something probably 80 years old!
